# Star-Wars-Character-Dynamics
An example of multiple bivariate relationships, as explored through "Star Wars"


The variables I chose are characters’ attitudes towards their environment, interpersonal conflict, character motivation, character’s proximity to economic power, character’s proximity to political power and character development. This data was collected by observing the 9 films in the Skywalker saga. 


 The first variable I will be measuring is character attitudes towards their environment. This variable will be operationalized by designating the different characters' overall feelings towards their environment into sections. The sections will range from pessimistic(1), neutral(2), positive(3). These sections will be determined by the characters overall mood, actions, or conclusions brought by their occupation or life choices. By operationalizing this variable, I will be able to understand how the setting of the films affects the characters.

 
 The second variable I will be measuring is interpersonal conflict. This variable will be operationalized by categorizing the amount of conflict between a specific character with other characters. The sections will be no conflict (1) , mild conflict (2) , and high conflict(3). The amount of conflict will be analyzed by viewing the character's conflict with others over the course of the film. These sections will be determined by the unspoken tension, verbal escalation or physical violence the characters display in the films . By operationalizing this variable, I will be able to understand how the interpersonal conflict shapes the overall narrative.

 
  The third variable I will be measuring is character motivation. This variable will be operationalized by categorizing the motivating factors of the characters in the films. The categories will be revenge (1), justice (2) , greed (3), power (4) and survival (5).  These categories will be determined by the viewing of the different characters’ either explicitly stated or heavily implied motivations through their actions or words. By operationalizing this variable, I will be able to understand why the characters do certain things.
  
The fourth variable I will be measuring is the character's proximity to economic power. This variable will be operationalized by using a scale from 1-5 to assign to the primary characters in the film.The rating of 1 will be assigned to characters that do not have close proximity to economic power 5 being a character that has direct connections to economic power. I will pay close attention to the primary characters' family ties, or interpersonal connections in relation to wealth.  By operationalizing this variable, the significance of wealth in the film will be numerically accessed. 

 	The fifth variable I will be measuring is the character's proximity to political power. Similarly to the previous variable, this variable will be operationalized by using a scale from 1-5 to assign to the primary characters in the films. The rating of 1 will be assigned to characters that do not have close proximity to political power and 5 being a character that has direct connections to political power. I will pay close attention to the primary characters' family ties, or interpersonal connections in relation to politics.  By operationalizing this variable, the significance of political power in the film will be numerically evaluated. 
  
The sixth and final variable I will be measuring is character development. This variable will be operationalized by using a scale from 1-5 to assign to the characters.  The rating of 1 will be assigned to characters that do not  change at all from their first appearance to their last and 5 being a character that has changed completely from their first appearance to their last. I will pay close attention to how characters’ personality or overall state has changed. By operationalizing this variable, the changes characters go through will be numerically evaluated.


	Access to all 9 Star Wars on either Disney Plus or other media distributors is required to replicate this project.
